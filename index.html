            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>We are a middle class couple from Louisville, Kentucky. Our interests are pool, food, and shopping. Louis travels to pool tournaments around the country. He also helps install Diamond pool tables. I work a full-time clerical night job.</p>

                <h2>Downtown Nashville, Tn</h2>

                <h3>Our first trip begins in Downtown Nashville Tennessee. We were both pretty stressed out with Covid, Money, Life. I am sure most people can relate. We had not been away somewhere that didn't involve pool for a long time, so my brilliant
                    boyfriend, Louis, suggested we go to Nashville.</h3>

                <p>I planned the trip the week before. Which really just involved reserving a hotel room and looking up attractions in Nashvile. The following is our awesome adventure in Music City, U.S.A.</p>




                <!-- Nashville Attractions -->

                        <h4>Hotel</h4>
                        <h4>For our stay, I chose the <a href="https://www.druryhotels.com/locations/nashville-tn/drury-plaza-hotel-nashville-downtown?utm_campaign=gmb-website&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google" target="_blank">Drury Plaza Hotel Nasvhille Downtown</a>.
                            I compared several hotels online, but I liked the options and price of this hotel.</h4>
                        <p>It included free breakfast, happy hour drinks, and most importantly in Nashville, had attached parking. The breakfast was excellent, but carrying it back to the room for privacy was a pain. You were given 3 drinks for happy hour
                            that you redeemed in an attached area to the bar. I chose a margarita which was excellent. There were 2 other options which I cannot recall. My boyfriend rarely drinks, so no help there. The attached parking garage was an additional
                            $20.00 a night, but in Downtown Nashville, it was worth it.</p>

                        <p>I chose a king suite. It had a lounge area and bedroom separated by the large bathroom. The bathroom had a separate soaking tub and shower, as well as a toilet closet. The bed was comfortable and having separate areas was great
                            since Lou wanted to sleep in. We had a small fridge, but to my extreme despair, no coffee maker. We had also wanted a balcony, but they do not have attached balconies. There is an outdoor lounge.</p>

                            <li><a href="https://bobs-steakandchop.com/nashville/" target="_blank">Bob's Steak & Chop house</a>
                                <p>Most amazing steak I have ever had! The baked potato was huge and the special carrot they serve is delicious! Pricey, but worth it.</p>

                            <li><a href="https://peglegporker.com/" target="_blank">Peg Leg Parker</a>
                                <p>Casual and reasonably priced. Dry rubbed ribs were amazing and half a slab fed my boyfriend and me. We were not impressed by the side items we ordered, macaroni and cheese and green beans.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><a href="https://fivedaughtersbakery.com/" target="_blank">Five Daughters Bakery</a>
                                <p>They have a 100 layer donut - enough said, right? It was filled with cream, which was too much for Louis, but my sweet tooth adored. They have a good selection including keto and glutton-free options. Be prepared for a

                                <p>An early morning jaunt sent me in search of good coffee. I had an espresso and it was quite good. They did seem to have a varied selection, but I am traditional with my coffee.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><a href="https://jenis.com/scoop-shops/jenis-nashville-farmers-market/" target="_blank">Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams</a>
                                <p>This was a indulgence at the Farmer's Market. Pricey, but so good. I had two scoops (that sweet tooth again!) and Louis had one. They have unusual flavors, but very creamy and amazing.</p>

                                <p>Known as the Mother Church of Country Music, the tour was quite interesting. If you enjoy old buildings and history like me then this is a must see. The attached gift shop is reasonable and has some quality t-shirts.</p>

                            <li><a href="https://countrymusichalloffame.org/" target="_blank">Country Music Hall of Fame</a>
                                <p>I had to include the Country Music Hall of Fame, though we did not get to take the tour. You can check out the building and gift shop without taking the tour. Definitely on my list for my next visit.</p>

                                <p>Sadly we missed the last tour. We did get to go through the gift shop, do some site-seeing, and take some pictures while we were there. Another goal added to my list.</p>

                                <p>A free museum. We did not get to go through due to time limitations. It is across from the Farmer's Market and Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park.</p>

                            <li><a href="https://www.nashvilleparthenon.com/" target="_blank">The Parthenon</a>
                                <p>Just wow. Louis and I both really enjoyed The Parthenon. The tour was priced quite reasonably. We enjoyed taking pictures outside before we had the indoor tour. It was informative, interesting, and visually enticing. There
                                    was so much history and artwork to see, we had to drag ourselves away.</p>

                                <p>We only got to spend a little time looking at the WWII and other outdoor exhibits. It was pretty neat and we both enjoyed it. I loved the quiet area and places to rest and cool off a little.</p>

                            <li><a href="https://www.nashvillefarmersmarket.org/" target="_blank">Nashville Farmer's Market</a>
                                <p>This was a bit of a disappointment for me. Maybe it was too early in the season, but it mostly had little restaurants. There was a wine shop with tastings, but I did not try it. We had some amazing nachos, but I cannot
                                    remember which place we stopped at.</p>

                                <p>A downtown shopping arcade that we didn't get to stop at. It has very good reviews and seems to be a good place for local art.</p>

                                <p>A bit of history, museum, and shopping all in one. Louis was not very enthusiastic about this stop until we got inside. It was pretty amazing. We both enjoyed looking at the artifacts displayed. I liked the small shops
                                    with local artists. Some were expensive, but all had interesting items. I did find some souveniers here. There was also a wine shop with tastings that I did enjoy. Wine slushies are my absolute favorite!</p>

                        he came home with a trophy! I also got to have some adventures of my own, besides just watching Lou play some amazing pool.

                    <p> We went with some friends, a married couple also from Louisville. Karen actually made the reservations and planned most of the trip. 
                        She chose a great Airbnb. It was my first time in Vegas not staying in a hotel and I was really glad Karen chose that option.
